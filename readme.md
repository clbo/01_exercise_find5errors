# Find 5 Errors

In the code we provide in [exercise.java](/exercise.java) there will be 5 errors.    
Your job is to identify where these errors are, and to fix them. A tip is to start out by pressing the debug *"+"* botton and look in the output pane. 
Here you will get a description about what is wrong in the code.

Like always: Fork this repo, and create a pull request when you are finnished.
